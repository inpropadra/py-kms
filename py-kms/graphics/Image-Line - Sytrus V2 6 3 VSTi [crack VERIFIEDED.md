## How to create a simple bass sound with Sytrus
 
One of the most common sounds that you can create with Sytrus is a bass sound. A bass sound is a low-pitched sound that provides the foundation and groove for your music. There are many types of bass sounds, such as sub bass, synth bass, electric bass, acoustic bass and more. In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a simple synth bass sound with Sytrus.
 
First, open FL Studio 21 and create a new project. Then, add Sytrus v2 6 3 VSTi as a channel in the Channel Rack. You can do this by clicking on the + button at the bottom of the Channel Rack and selecting Sytrus from the list of plugins. Alternatively, you can drag and drop Sytrus from the Plugin Database in the File Browser to the Channel Rack.
 
Once you have added Sytrus to the Channel Rack, double-click on it to open its interface. You will see a window with several tabs and controls. The main tab is the Operator tab, where you can adjust the parameters of each oscillator (operator). By default, Sytrus has six operators (labeled A to F), but only one (A) is active. You can activate or deactivate an operator by clicking on its button at the top of the Operator tab.
 
To create a simple bass sound, we will use only one operator (A). The other operators will be turned off for now. You can change the shape and pitch of the operator by adjusting the knobs and sliders in the Operator tab. For example, you can change the shape from sine to saw by dragging the SHAPE knob to the right. You can also change the pitch by dragging the COARSE knob up or down.
 
For our bass sound, we will use a saw shape with a low pitch. Set the SHAPE knob to about 0.75 and the COARSE knob to -24. This will give us a low and buzzy sound. You can also adjust the FINE knob to slightly detune the pitch for a thicker sound.
 
Next, we will add some filter and envelope to our bass sound. The filter is used to cut off some frequencies from the sound, making it more smooth or sharp. The envelope is used to control how the sound changes over time, such as its volume, pitch and filter.
 
To access the filter and envelope settings for our operator (A), click on the FILTER tab at the top of Sytrus interface. You will see a window with several knobs and sliders for adjusting the filter type, cutoff frequency, resonance and envelope amount. You will also see a graph that shows how the filter envelope changes over time.
 
For our bass sound, we will use a low-pass filter with a moderate cutoff frequency and resonance. A low-pass filter allows only low frequencies to pass through, while cutting off high frequencies. This will make our bass sound more smooth and warm. Set the FILTER TYPE knob to LP (low-pass) and drag the CUTOFF knob to about 0.5. You can also increase the RESO knob slightly to add some character to our bass sound.
 
Next, we will adjust the filter envelope to make our bass sound more dynamic and expressive. The filter envelope controls how the cutoff frequency changes over time according to four parameters: attack, decay, sustain and release (ADSR). The attack determines how quickly the cutoff frequency rises from zero to its maximum value when you press a note. The decay determines how quickly the cutoff frequency falls from its maximum value to its sustain value after the attack phase. The sustain determines what value the cutoff frequency holds while you hold down a note. The release determines how quickly the cutoff frequency falls from its sustain value to zero when you release a note.
 
For our bass sound, we want a short attack, a short decay, a low sustain and a short release for our filter envelope. This will make our bass sound more plucky and punchy. To adjust these

The demo version can repair half the size of the original video file. If you want to repair the full size of the video file, you need to purchase the full version for $40. Here are the steps to use Video Repair Tool Grau Gbr to repair your corrupt or damaged video files:
 
1. Download and extract the video repair tool archive (.zip) from their website[^1^] [^2^]. For PC users, right-click the downloaded .zip file in Windows Explorer and choose 'Extract all...'. For Mac users, double-click the downloaded .zip file in the Mac Finder.
2. Run the video repair tool application (gs.exe for PC users or gs.app for Mac users) from the extracted folder.
3. Select your corrupt or damaged video file by clicking on 'Choose movie' button. You can also drag and drop your video file into the application window.
4. Select a reference movie that has the same format and codec as your corrupt or damaged video file by clicking on 'Choose reference movie' button.

If you don't have a reference movie, you can skip this step.
5. Click on 'Scan' button to start repairing your video file. The software will analyze your video file and try to reconstruct the raw video and audio stream data. You can see the progress of the repair process on the application window.

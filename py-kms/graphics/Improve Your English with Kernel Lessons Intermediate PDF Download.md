This means that each lesson is based on a simple sentence or a kernel that contains the main idea of the lesson. The kernel is then expanded and modified in various ways to show different grammatical structures and meanings. For example, the kernel "He is a teacher" can be changed to "He was a teacher", "He has been a teacher", "He is not a teacher", "Is he a teacher?", "Who is he?", etc. This way, you can learn how to form different types of sentences and questions in English.

You can practice your reading comprehension and learn new words and expressions from these texts. The book also has audio recordings that accompany some of the lessons and help you improve your listening and pronunciation skills.

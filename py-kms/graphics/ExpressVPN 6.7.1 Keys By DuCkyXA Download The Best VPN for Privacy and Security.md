However, some players who downloaded the Fitgirl repack of Ziggurat (Update 12) have encountered a problem: the game fails to launch and shows an error message saying that steam\_api.dll is missing. This file is part of the Steam emulator that allows you to play cracked games without Steam. If it is missing or corrupted, the game will not work.
 
Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to fix this issue and enjoy Ziggurat (Update 12) Fitgirl repack without any problems. Here are some steps you can try:
 
1. Check your antivirus program. Sometimes, antivirus programs can falsely detect steam\_api.dll as a threat and quarantine or delete it. To prevent this, you need to restore the file from your antivirus quarantine and add it or the game folder to your antivirus exclusion list. You can also disable your antivirus temporarily while playing the game.
2. Download the steam\_api.dll file from a reliable source. If you don't have the file or it is damaged, you can download it from a website that provides dll files for various programs. Make sure you download the correct version of the file for your system (32-bit or 64-bit) and scan it for viruses before using it. Then, copy the file to your game folder where Ziggurat.exe is located.
3. Run the game as administrator. Sometimes, steam\_api.dll needs elevated permissions to work properly. To do this, right-click on Ziggurat.exe and select "Run as administrator". This may solve the error and allow you to play the game.

If none of these steps work, you may need to reinstall the game or try a different repack. You can also contact Fitgirl or visit their website for more support and information.

## How to Use ECM Titanium
 
Once you have activated ECM Titanium, you can start using it to edit your ECU files. To do this, you need to connect your ECU to your computer using a compatible device, such as a KESS V2 or a KTAG. You also need to have the correct driver for your ECU model.
 
After connecting your ECU to your computer, open ECM Titanium and click on the "Open File" button. You will see a window where you can browse and select the ECU file that you want to edit. You can either read the file from your ECU or load it from your computer if you have a backup.
 
Once you have selected the file, ECM Titanium will automatically detect the driver for your ECU and show you the parameters that you can modify. You will see a list of maps on the left side of the screen and a graphical representation of the selected map on the right side. You can use the tools on the toolbar to zoom in, zoom out, move, rotate, and edit the map.
 
To edit a map, you need to select the cells that you want to change and enter the new values in the "Edit" window. You can also use the "2D" and "3D" buttons to switch between different views of the map. You can also use the "Compare" button to compare the original and modified maps.
 
After editing the map, you need to save the file by clicking on the "Save File" button. You will be asked to enter a name and a description for the modified file. You can then write the file back to your ECU or save it on your computer.

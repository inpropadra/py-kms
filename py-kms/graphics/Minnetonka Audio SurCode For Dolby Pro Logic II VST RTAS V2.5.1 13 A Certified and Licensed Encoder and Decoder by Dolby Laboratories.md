If you are looking for a way to encode your 5.1 surround mixes into stereo sound files that can be played back on any stereo system, you might want to check out Minnetonka Audio SurCode For Dolby Pro Logic II VST RTAS V2.5.1 13. This software matrix encoder is a plug-in that works with Avid or VST digital audio workstations (DAWs), and allows you to easily create stereo LTRT (Left Total/Right Total) files that contain the full surround information.
 
SurCode For Dolby Pro Logic II uses the same phase and amplitude behavior of the Pro Logic II consumer decoding chain, which means you can monitor and correct your mixes in real time, without having to export and decode them separately. You can also measure the loudness of your source multichannel content, LORO (Left Only/Right Only) stream, or the undecoded stereo LTRT stem, using Minnetonka Audio's industry-standard loudness measurement technology.

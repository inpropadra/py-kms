# TopoGun v2.00: A Powerful Tool for 3D Artists
 
TopoGun is a stand-alone resurfacing and maps baking application that allows 3D artists to create high-quality meshes from scanned, sculpted, or imported data. TopoGun can also generate various types of texture maps, such as normal, displacement, ambient occlusion, curvature, and more.
 
In this article, we will review some of the features and benefits of TopoGun v2.00, which is the latest version of this software. We will also provide a download link for the TOPOGUN v2.00 Build12464 (x86.x64).rar file, which contains the installation files for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

## What's New in TopoGun v2.00?
 
TopoGun v2.00 has been improved and updated with many new features and enhancements, such as:
 
- Improved user interface: TopoGun v2.00 has a more intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows you to access all the tools and options easily.
- Linux support: TopoGun v2.00 and TopoGun License Server are now available for the Linux operating system and have been tested on CentOS 5.6, Fedora 14, and Ubuntu 11.
- Symmetry: The Symmetry feature has been rewritten and it works with all the tools. You can create custom Symmetry Planes and Symmetry Warps, so you can use symmetry on arbitrarily rotated objects or on objects with slightly asymmetrical features.
- Morpher: The Morpher extension helps you modify the reference mesh and have the modifications bounced back to the scene geometry. This way you can basically review the highpoly sculpting process after the lowpoly retopologized version was created. The Morpher can also be used for creating lowpoly versions of digitally sculpted blendshapes or for posing lowpoly geometries like their corresponding highpoly references.
- Draw tool: The Draw tool has been upgraded, it supports two new line types, the Section lines and the Sweep lines, which help you retopologize cylindrical parts of the reference mesh.
- Tubes tool: The new Tubes tool also helps you retopologize cylindrical parts of the reference mesh, by using a slightly different approach.
- Brush tool: The Brush tool allows you to modify vertices with industry-standard brushes and tablet pressure sensitivity support.
- Extrude tool: The Extrude tool allows for border edges extrusions.
- File history: You can access the latest opened/saved scenes from within the File menu.
- Scene crash recovery: TopoGun v2.00 makes it impossible to lose any scene data due to unexpected software errors.
- Merge Scene: You can merge polygon data into an existing scene from external files.
- To Full Shell command: This command helps selecting the current geometry shell, including its vertices, edges, and polygons.
- Spin Edges command: This command allows you to rotate selected edges around their common vertex.
- Select Path: This command now works on edges too.
- Online activated license: You can now return your online activated license to the server via the website (from the Return License page).
- Interactive Help System: This feature shows an information box in the viewport for each interface element you move the mouse cursor over.
